				<body style="background-color: #A9A9A9;">
					<p><h3>A strong brand identity means that it is seamlessly woven throughout all aspects of your business<h3></p>
<p><h3><center>Apple has proven itself to be a highly memorable brand, its logo is iconic and its brand essence is permanently engraved in the annals of pop culture. They have become one of the most easily recalled brands through years of reinforcing their brand image and continually reminding consumers who they are and what they do
Perhaps the most important aspect of a good brand identity is that it is consistent</center></h3></p>  <p><h3>Brand identity will lose significant impact if the consumer is receiving different messages from your sales team than it was getting from your marketing team.</h3></p>
<h2>Increasing brand recall ensures consumers feel comfort and familiarity with your brand, making them more likely to gravitate towards your brand over competitors in the future</h2>
<h3>As we continue our innovations in products, we solidify our leadership in the tech industry by investing in future technology like 5G/6G, AI, and robotics.
Our global presence is manifested through our CI, the lettermark, to customers around the world.</h3>

<p><h3>** Since their founding in the 1970s, Apple has kept consistent goals and messaging. While its imagery and logo may have changed throughout the years, its brand identity of being a youthful, cutting-edge and creative tech company has remained consistent and at the forefront of all its touchpoints.</h3></p>
<p><h3>** Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.  </h3></p>
