<h4>What we began in 1969 has evolved and expanded through the decades. In Korean, the word ‘Samsung’ means “three stars” and the name carries the founder Lee Byung-chull’s vision for the company – to shine like stars in the sky, large, strong and eternally shining. The word ‘three’ represents large, plentiful, and strong while ‘star’ means bright, lofty and eternally shining. Since then, we’ve been marching on to a whole universe of possibilities. We’re excited to share the heritage of our brand with you – the story of how it all unfolded. Come explore the milestones of our company and the evolution of our logo over the years.</h4>
