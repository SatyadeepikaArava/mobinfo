		<h4>MAKING QUALITY TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE.</h4>
<h3><p> •	Xiaomi was founded in 2010 by serial entrepreneur Lei Jun based on the vision “innovation for everyone”. We believe that high-quality products built with cutting-edge technology should be made accessible to everyone. We create remarkable hardware, software, and Internet services for and with the help of our Mi fans. We incorporate their feedback into our product range, which currently includes Mi and Redmi smartphones, Mi TVs and set-top boxes, Mi routers, and Mi Ecosystem products including smart home products, wearables and other accessories. With presence in over 30 countries and regions, Xiaomi is expanding its footprint across the world to become a global brand.</p></h3>
<h3>The "MI" in our logo stands for “Mobile Internet”. It also has other meanings, including "Mission Impossible", because Xiaomi faced many challenges that
had seemed impossible to defy in our early days
</h3>
<h4>Xiaomi is focused on being the most user-centric mobile internet company, and we aim to constantly exceed expectations through innovations in software, hardware and services</h4>
<h4><center>. Xiaomi is headquartered in Beijing, China and has offices in Asia-Pacific, India, and Europe..</center></h4>
<h3>Our team is not only passionate about technology, but also relentlessly pursues perfection to break tradition and push boundaries, all just to ensure that our products remain unique and offer an unparalleled user experience..</h3>
